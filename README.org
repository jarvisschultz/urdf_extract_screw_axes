* About

This is a simple package for parsing [[http://wiki.ros.org/urdf][Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)]]
files describing the kinematics and dynamics of a robotic manipulator, and
automatically extracting screw axes in either a spatial frame or a body frame.

The format of the screw axes descriptions is suitable for use with the
[[https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics][ModernRobotics]] library developed to accompany the book "Modern Robotics:
Mechanics, Planning, and Control," by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park,
Cambridge University Press, 2017. More about the book at [[http://lynchandpark.org][lynchandpark.org]].

** Limitations and Assumptions

* Example

* Dependencies:
** Building Dependencies
   + [[http://www.numpy.org/][Numpy]] :: Required for numerical computations and array handling
   + [[https://github.com/ros/urdf_parser_py][urdf_parser_py]] :: Required for parsing URDFs. May be installable through
        system package manager

** Testing Dependencies
   + [[https://github.com/NxRLab/ModernRobotics][ModernRobotics]] :: Required for verifying forward kinematics calculations
        with the screws extracted from URDFs
